Hey there! this is training project, we are currently learning JAVASCRIPT.
we'll use JavaScript to build a browser-based video game that we'll enter in a fictional hackathon called the Con Solo Game Jam, which has the following rules:

The game must be created by a single developer in 24 hours.
The game must run in a web browser.
The game must use the provided index.html file.
Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed.
Participants cannot use CSS.
All game code must be contained in the game.js JavaScript file.
We will be creating a minimal viable product, meaning it will be the simplest version of an app.
  
  ## Motivation
  Javascript is everything in web world. we used it daily, to post videos, to watch videos, to play games. so it is very important to learn this concept, because it really is the most important thing. 
  
  ## BUILD STATUS:
  Communicate with the game player by using JavaScript functions.
Assign and manipulate data using JavaScript variables and operators.
Control the flow of the application by managing conditional statements.
